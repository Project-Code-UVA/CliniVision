# Assuming your target diagnoses are somehow encoded or available in `diagnoses_encoded`
# This part will need to be adjusted based on how you decide to represent diagnoses
# For demonstration, let's assume a simple binary classification for a single disease
# Example: aggregated_data['has_disease'] = (aggregated_data['class_name_Lung Opacity'] > 0).astype(int)

# Prepare input (X) and output (y) for the model
X = aggregated_data.drop(['image_id', 'class_id', 'x_min', 'y_min', 'x_max', 'y_max'], axis=1)  # Adjust as necessary
# y should be your target variable, which needs to be prepared based on your project's specifics
# For this example, we'll pretend 'has_disease' is our target
y = aggregated_data['class_name_Lung Opacity']  # Placeholder for actual target variable

# Split the data into training and validation sets

model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Note: This code is for demonstration and will need adjustments for real-world application,
# especially in preparing the target variable and possibly fine-tuning the model architecture.
