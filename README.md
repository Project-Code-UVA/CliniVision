# CliniVision

CliniVision is a multifaceted project that seeks to shorten patient wait times within hospital settings.
Due to restrictions and policies, x-rays and diagnoses can only be made by appropriate careproviders.
The CliniVision tool's final goal is to take in a fresh postanterior chest x-ray and label the x-ray with the symptoms found within the x-ray.

0 - Aortic enlargement <br />
1 - Atelectasis <br />
2 - Calcification <br />
3 - Cardiomegaly <br />
4 - Consolidation <br />
5 - ILD <br />
6 - Infiltration <br />
7 - Lung Opacity <br />
8 - Nodule/Mass <br />
9 - Other lesion <br />
10 - Pleural effusion <br />
12 - Pneumothorax <br />
13 - Pulmonary fibrosis <br />
14 - No finding <br />

Once symptoms are highlighted, the tool will proceed to take in the known symptoms and their location, and assign a proper diagnosis for the x-ray input. <br />
