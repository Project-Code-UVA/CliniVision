# CliniVision

CliniVision is a multifaceted project that seeks to shorten patient wait times within hospital settings.
Due to restrictions and policies, x-rays and diagnoses can only be made by appropriate careproviders.
The CliniVision tool's final goal is to take in a fresh postanterior chest x-ray and label the x-ray with the symptoms found within the x-ray.

0 - Aortic enlargement
1 - Atelectasis
2 - Calcification
3 - Cardiomegaly
4 - Consolidation
5 - ILD
6 - Infiltration
7 - Lung Opacity
8 - Nodule/Mass
9 - Other lesion
10 - Pleural effusion
12 - Pneumothorax
14 - No finding

Once symptoms are highlighted, the tool will proceed to take in the known symptoms and their location, and assign a proper diagnosis for the x-ray input.
