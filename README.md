# CliniVision

CliniVision is a multifaceted project that seeks to shorten patient wait times within hospital settings.
Due to restrictions and policies, x-rays and diagnoses can only be made by appropriate careproviders.
The CliniVision tool's final goal is to take in a fresh postanterior chest x-ray and label the x-ray with the symptoms found within the x-ray.

\n0 - Aortic enlargement
\n1 - Atelectasis
\n2 - Calcification
\n3 - Cardiomegaly
\n4 - Consolidation
\n5 - ILD
\n6 - Infiltration
\n7 - Lung Opacity
\n8 - Nodule/Mass
\n9 - Other lesion
\n10 - Pleural effusion
\n12 - Pneumothorax
\n14 - No finding

\nOnce symptoms are highlighted, the tool will proceed to take in the known symptoms and their location, and assign a proper diagnosis for the x-ray input.
